		"title": "Welcome to our website!",
		"content": "I'm Dr. Nándor Tombácz, veterinary surgeon. Following my graduation (cum laude) in 1984, I specialized in farm animal medicine, working in intensive, as well as smallholder settings. \n As a result of the decline in farm animal stocks due to the change of political regime, I moved on to state veterinary service, and became the Veterinary Lead for the Border Control Post in Rajka. I completed my qualification in public administration in 1996. \n In the meantime, I established my companion animal veterinary surgery in Mosonmagyaróvár and expanded my services by selling pharmaceuticals, feed and pet food, equipment and other supplies for animals. \n To enable us to provide all of our services in one place, the practice moved to its current location in 2004. From 2007, I attended a 3-year specialist course in companion animal medicine. Today, together with my assistant, we provide veterinary care for pets, and supply farm animal keepers with medicines and pharmaceuticals."
